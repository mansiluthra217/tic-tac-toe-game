The Tic-Tac-Toe game will be developed as a web application that can be played by two players on the same device. The game consists of a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking their symbol (either "X" or "O") in one of the grid's cells. The first player to align three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. 

Key Features:
1. User Interface
2. Game Logic
3. Restart Functionality

The Tic-Tac-Toe project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript covers essential concepts and techniques in web design and programming while delivering a fun and interactive experience.
